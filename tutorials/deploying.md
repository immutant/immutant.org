This tutorial covers creating a basic [Ring] web application and deploying 
to an Immutant. If you haven't read the [installation tutorial][installing], 
go do so now, since you'll need Immutant and the lein-immutant plugin 
installed. This tutorial assumes you are on a *nix system.

## Creating an Immutant Clojure application

In our [installation tutorial][installing], we installed the [lein plugin]. Let's take another
look at the tasks it provides:

    ~/immutant $ lein immutant
    Manage the deployment lifecycle of an Immutant application.
    
    Subtasks available:
    undeploy   Undeploys a project from the Immutant specified by ~/.lein/immutant/current or $IMMUTANT_HOME
    new        Creates a new project skeleton initialized for Immutant.
    archive    Creates an Immutant archive from a project
    deploy     Deploys a project to the Immutant specified by ~/.lein/immutant/current or $IMMUTANT_HOME
    run        Starts up the Immutant specified by ~/.lein/immutant/current or $IMMUTANT_HOME, displaying its console output
    env        Displays paths to the Immutant that the plugin can find
    overlay    Overlays features onto ~/.lein/immutant/current or $IMMUTANT_HOME
    init       Adds a sample immutant.init namespace to an existing project
    test       Runs tests inside an Immutant, after starting one (if necessary) and deploying the project
    version    Prints version info for the current Immutant if it can be determined
    install    Downloads and installs Immutant
    eval       Eval some code in a remote nrepl

In this tutorial we'll cover the `new` and `deploy` tasks. To do so, 
we'll build a basic application that demonstrates the current web features. To get
started, let's create an Immutant project:

    ~/immutant $ lein new immutant immutant-demo
    Generating a project called immutant-demo based on the 'immutant' template.
    
The `new` task creates a [Leiningen] project and gives it a sample Immutant bootstrap
namespace (`src/immutant/init.clj`). Alternatively, you can use the
`init` task to initialize a pre-existing [Leiningen] project:

    ~/immutant $ lein new immutant-demo && cd immutant-demo && lein immutant init

We'll come back to `src/immutant/init.clj` in a sec. Now, let's add a ring handler to our core namespace:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(ns immutant-demo.core)

(defn ring-handler [request]
  {:status 200
    :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
    :body "Hello from Immutant!" })
</pre>

## Configuring the application for Immutant
    
An application can be bootstrapped when deployed to Immutant in a
number of ways, one of which is the `immutant.init` namespace. It can
be used to configure the Immutant services you want your application
to consume. It provides a single place for you to define all the
components required by your application, and saves you from having to
keep external configuration files in sync (crontabs, message queue
definitions, init scripts, etc). Anything you create within
`src/immutant/init.clj` can instead be created anywhere in your
application, of course - it just provides a convenient place to do so.

The file has example code for configuring web endpoints and messaging
services, but we're just going to deal with web endpoints in this
article. Edit your `src/immutant/init.clj` so it looks like:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(ns immutant.init
  (:use immutant-demo.core)
  (:require [immutant.messaging :as messaging]
            [immutant.web :as web]))

(web/start ring-handler)
</pre>

We'll come back to what `web/start` is doing after we get the application running.

## Deploying your application

Before we can start up an Immutant, we need to tell it about our application. We do that
by deploying:

    ~/immutant/immutant-demo $ lein immutant deploy
    Deployed immutant-demo to /Users/tobias/immutant/current/jboss/standalone/deployments/immutant-demo.clj

This writes a *deployment descriptor* to Immutant's deploy directory which points back
to the application's root directory. Now the Immutant can find your application - so let's 
fire it up.

## Starting Immutant

To launch an Immutant, use the `lein immutant run` command. This will
start the Immutant's JBoss server, and will run in the foreground displaying the console log.
You'll see lots of log messages that you can ignore - the
one to look for should be the last message, and should tell you the app was deployed:

    ~/immutant/immutant-demo $ lein immutant run
    Starting Immutant via /Users/tobias/immutant/current/jboss/bin/standalone.sh
    ...
    (a plethora of log messages deleted)
    ...
    13:04:39,888 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.controller] (DeploymentScanner-threads - 2) Deployed "immutant-demo.clj"
    
Now, let's verify that our app is really there. Immutant runs on port 8080 by default, so 
let's hit it and see what happens:

    ~ $ curl http://localhost:8080/immutant-demo/
    Hello from Immutant!

Yay!

You can kill the Immutant with Ctrl-C.

## Context Paths

Remember our call to `web/start` earlier? Let's talk about what that is doing. To 
do that, however, we need to first talk about *context paths*. The context path is 
the portion of the URL between the hostname and the routes (aka 'path info') within 
the application. It basically tells Immutant which requests to route to a particular
application.

An Immutant can host multiple applications at the same time, but each application must 
have a unique context path. If no context path is provided when an application
is deployed, it defaults to one based on the name of the deployment. The 
deployment name is taken from the name of the deployment descriptor, which
in turn is taken from the name of the project given to `defproject` in
`project.clj` (you can override this via the `--name` argument to the deploy command). 
So for our sample app above, the context path defaults to 
`/immutant-demo`. You can override this default by specifying
a `:context-path` within an `:immutant` map in your `project.clj`. Let's
go ahead and do that:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(defproject immutant-demo "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A basic demo"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.3.0"]]
  :immutant {:context-path "/"})
</pre>

Now, when your app is deployed the context path will be picked up
from your `project.clj` and any
web endpoints your application stands up will be accessible under that
context path.

If you want to set the context path for a particular deployment of a project instead
of globally, you can set the context path in the deployment descriptor via the 
`--context-path` option to the deploy command:

    ~/immutant/immutant-demo $ lein immutant deploy --context-path /

Which brings us back to `web/start`. `web/start` stands up a web endpoint
for you, and takes one or two arguments: an optional *sub-context path* 
and a [Ring] handler function. The sub-context path is relative to the application's context
path, so a context path of "/ham" and a sub-context path of "/" makes
the handler function available at `/ham`, whereas a sub-context path
of "/biscuits" makes the handler function available at `/ham/biscuits`.
If no sub-context path is provided, it is assumed to be "/". Make sense?

You can register as many web endpoints as you like within an application -
they just each need an application unique sub-context path. If we add 
this to our `core.clj`:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(defn another-ring-handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Pssst! Over here!"})
</pre>

And this to our `immutant.clj`:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(web/start "/biscuits" another-ring-handler)</pre>

Then fire an Immutant up again with `lein immutant run`, we can see they
both work:

    ~ $ curl http://localhost:8080
    Hello from Immutant!
    ~ $ curl http://localhost:8080/biscuits
    Pssst! Over here!

`web/start` has a companion function for shutting down a web endpoint:
`web/stop`. It takes an optional sub-context path for the endpoint, and can
be called from anywhere. If no sub-context path is provided, "/" is assumed.
You aren't required to shut down your endpoints -
Immutant will do that on your behalf when it is shut down or the application 
is undeployed.

## Wrapping up

We hope you've enjoyed this quick run-through of deploying a web application
to Immutant. Since Immutant is still in an alpha state, none of what I
said above is set in stone. If anything does change, We'll edit this tutorial
to keep it accurate. We've posted the [demo application] we've built if you want
to download it.
