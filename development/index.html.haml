  #intro

      The Immutant team fully welcomes all contributors to the project. We have attempted to
      organize our code and development tools to make it easy for community members to participate
      as deeply as they desire.

        The code is developed as open-source, with a publicly-accessible
        <a href="http://github.com/immutant/immutant">source-code repository</a>.

      %p
        All of the code for Immutant is open-source under the <a href="/license-lgpl.txt">LGPL</a>.
        You may checkout the latest code under development at any time.

        The primary source repository is located at GitHub, and is obviously using
        the Git revision-control system.

      %p
        Using Git and GitHub, it's simple for contributors to fork the code to develop
        bugfixes or features, and easily integrate their codelines back with the
        primary codebase, including all attribution and history.
