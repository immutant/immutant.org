    There are currently two options for installing Immutant: using the 
    Leiningen plugin and downloading a zip file.

    %h2 Installation via Leiningen

    :markdown
      _**Note:** These instructions are for Leiningen >= 1.6.2 and < 2.0. A version of the plugin supporting Leiningen 2 is currently in the works._

      To install Immutant via the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) plugin, you'll need to
      first install Leiningen, followed by the [lein-immutant](https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant/)
      plugin:
          $ lein plugin install lein-immutant VERSION

      You can determine the current version of the plugin by looking at
      its [page on clojars](http://clojars.org/lein-immutant).

      The plugin provides a number of subcommands, one of which is
      `install`. So installing Immutant is as easy as this:
          $ lein immutant install [VERSION]

      Without a VERSION specified, the latest successful incremental build
      will be installed. To obtain fixes released in subsequent incremental 
      builds, Simply run `install` again.

      To obtain a specific version, you can specify an incremental build 
      number (ex: 123) or a released version (ex: #{latest_release.version}).
      _**Note:** installing a released version requires version **0.6.0** or newer
      of the plugin._

      Releases installed via the plugin are installed by default under
      `~/.lein/immutant/releases`, and `~/.lein/immutant/current` is 
      linked to that release. You can specify an alternative parent install
      directory by passing it as the third argument to `install`:
          $ lein immutant install VERSION /path/where/you/want/it
      The plugin will install Immutant there, and link `~/.lein/immutant/current`
      to that version.

    %h2 Installation via Zip Download

    :markdown
      You can manually download any of the same builds that you can install 
      via the plugin. You can download incremental builds from the
      [builds page](/builds/), and official releases from the announcement
      for that release. 

      Once you have the zip downloaded, expand it somewhere handy. If you want
      to use the Leiningen plugin with this build, you'll need to set `$IMMUTANT_HOME`:
          $ mkdir immutant-releases
          $ cd immutant-releases
          $ unzip path/to/immutant-dist-bin.zip
          $ export $IMMUTANT_HOME=~/immutant-releases/0.1.0/
